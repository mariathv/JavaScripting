      <h1>ONE PIECE</h1>
      <p>
        Barely surviving in a barrel after passing through a terrible whirlpool
        at sea, carefree Monkey D. Luffy ends up aboard a ship under attack by
        fearsome pirates. Despite being a naive-looking teenager, he is not to
        be underestimated. Unmatched in battle, Luffy is a pirate himself who
        resolutely pursues the coveted One Piece treasure and the King of the
        Pirates title that comes with it. The late King of the Pirates, Gol D.
        Roger, stirred up the world before his death by disclosing the
        whereabouts of his hoard of riches and daring everyone to obtain it.
        Ever since then, countless powerful pirates have sailed dangerous seas
        for the prized One Piece only to never return. Although Luffy lacks a
        crew and a proper ship, he is endowed with a superhuman ability and an
        unbreakable spirit that make him not only a formidable adversary but
        also an inspiration to many. As he faces numerous challenges with a big
        smile on his face, Luffy gathers one-of-a-kind companions to join him in
        his ambitious endeavor, together embracing perils and wonders on their
        once-in-a-lifetime adventure.

      <h1>ATTACK ON TITAN</h1>
      <p>
        Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous
        humanoid creatures called Titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind
        enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is
        that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what
        appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of
        humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one
        hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile
        calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the
        supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival
        against the man-eating abominations. After witnessing a horrific
        personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager
        dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey
        Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids
        outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa
        Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war
        against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before
        the last walls are breached.

      <h1>MASHLE : MAGIC AND MUSCLES</h1>
      <p>
        In this magical world, one is easily identified as having magical
        abilities by a distinctive mark on their face. Those unable to practice
        magic are swiftly exterminated to maintain the magical integrity of
        society. However, deep within a forest lies an anomaly in Mash
        Burnedead, who can be found pumping iron with one arm and lifting a
        cream puff with the other. This aloof boy with superhuman strength—but
        no magical abilities—leads a quiet life with his father, far removed
        from society. Mash's peace is soon disturbed when the authorities
        discover his lack of magical powers. They issue him an ultimatum:
        compete to become a "Divine Visionary," which would force everyone to
        accept him, or be persecuted forever. To protect his family, he enrolls
        in the prestigious Easton Magic Academy, which only the most elite and
        gifted students are allowed to attend. Now, Mash must overcome his
        shortcomings as a magicless being and surpass the other students—relying
        solely on his muscles.
